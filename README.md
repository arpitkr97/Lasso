Features Added with JavaScript


Status Change Alert:

When a user changes the dropdown in the "Customer Service" section, a JavaScript alert displays the selected status.


Dynamic Comments:

Users can type a comment in the input box and click the "Add Comment" button to dynamically add a new comment to the panel.
Each new comment includes a "Reply" button.







How to Test This:

Save the code as index.html.
Open the file in your browser.

Try:


Selecting a different status in the dropdown (you'll see an alert).
Adding new comments using the input field
and "Add Comment" button. New comments will dynamically appear in the comment panel.









Tailwind CSS Benefits with JavaScript:


Tailwindâ€™s utility-first approach ensures that dynamically created elements (like comments) automatically inherit consistent styles.



You can add hover, focus, or active states directly using Tailwind classes, reducing the need for additional CSS files.
